Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     1 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  1
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         16 out of  69,120    1%
    Number used as logic:                       16 out of  69,120    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              16

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     4 out of  17,280    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           16
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            15 out of      16   93%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      16    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           1 out of      16    6%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  69,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        49 out of     640    7%

Specific Feature Utilization:

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                1.31

Peak Memory Usage:  1038 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  13 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   13 secs 

Mapping completed.
